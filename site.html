  <h1>TEDx Program</h1>
  <p>TEDx is a grassroots initiative, created in the spirit of TED’s overall mission to research and discover “ideas worth spreading.”
     TEDx brings the spirit of TED to local communities around the globe through TEDx events. These events are organized by passionate
     individuals who seek to uncover new ideas and to share the latest research in their local areas that spark conversations in their
     communities. TEDx events include live speakers and recorded TED Talks, and are organized independently under a free license granted
     by TED. These events are not controlled by TED, but event organizers agree to abide by our format, and are offered guidelines for curation
     , speaker coaching, event organizing and more. They learn from us and from each other. More than 3000 events are now held annually. </p>
